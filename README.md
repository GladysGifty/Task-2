# COMPANY : CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

# NAME: S.Gladys Gifty

# INTERN ID : CT04DG1216

# DOMAIN : PYTHON PROGRAMMING

# DURATION : 4 WEEKS

# MENTOR : NEELA SANTHOSH

# DESCRIPTION : In this internship task, the goal was to build an automated system for reading data from a file, analyzing it, and generating a formatted PDF report. This project provides a hands-on approach for gaining experience with data processing, extracting insights, and presenting results in a professional, printable format. The tools used and the workflow developed are foundational for many real-world applications across industries.

Tools Used in the Project
1. Python
Python serves as the core programming language for this project. Its versatility and readability make it ideal for working with files, processing data, and generating documents. Python is a popular language in data analytics, web development, artificial intelligence, and countless other fields, making it an ideal choice for tasks like automated reporting.

2. CSV (Comma-Separated Values)
A .csv (Comma-Separated Values) file is a plain-text format used to store tabular data such as names, departments, and salaries. In this project, data.csv serves as the input file, making it easy to review, edit, and import into a program. This approach mirrors how many businesses maintain structured information in databases or spreadsheets.

3. csv Module (Python Standard Library)
The built-in csv module in Python allows seamless reading and writing of .csv files. In this project, it was used to:

Open the data.csv file.

Parse the contents.

Organize data into an accessible structure (such as a list of dictionaries).
This approach ensures that the data can be easily manipulated and analyzed before creating the final output.

4. fpdf Library
The fpdf library is a popular tool in Python for creating PDFs. Its simple syntax allows developers to:

Add titles, text, and tables.

Adjust font styles and sizes.

Export clean, professional reports.

In this project, fpdf was used to:

Create a formatted PDF document.

Add a title, total employee count, and a table listing employee names, departments, and salaries.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE TOOLS 
1. Business Reports and HR Applications
In many businesses, HR departments maintain employee databases. This script can be used to:

Read employee information from files.

Analyze salaries and departmental counts.

Export clean PDF reports for meetings and audits.

2. Financial and Sales Reports
Financial departments can adapt this approach for extracting transaction data from files and converting them into printable PDFs for stakeholders, making the review process straightforward.

3. Education and Student Management
Schools and universities can utilize this method for creating automated student reports:

Read data from a database or .csv file.

Perform analyses (such as average marks).

Export results as PDFs for parent-teacher meetings.
